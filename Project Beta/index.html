  <h1> Debunking "healthy food"  marketing myths</h1>
  <h2>

  1.You are not a baby cow! Cow’s milk is produced by nature as the IDEAL FOOD FOR BABY COWS- you are an adult human

Why are you casually drinking cow’s milk and not your cat’s or dog’s milk?

Humans are the ONLY species that drinks milk from another species, plus so long after childhood.

Would you go into nature and suckle from a cow?

<br>2. 75% of the population is lactose intolerant and the majority never diagnose it (the smaller percentage that is not is mostly Caucasians)

<br>3. You are drinking ANTIBIOTICS and GROWTH HORMONES
From the mass production process
<br>4. Milk increases OSTEOPOROSIS and HIP FRACTURES- contrary to the belief that you must drink milk for strong bones.

<br>5. LINKED TO INCREASED RISK FOR MANY CANCERS.
Casein-milk protein increases IGF-1 (which is linked to ovarian, prostate cancer and others)

<br>6. High saturated fats in all dairy (cheese,butter,milk...) increase cholesterol and can lead to HEART DISEASE
